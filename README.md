# CISC450 Final Project


## Overview

For this final project, we were to choose a topic and desgin a database to support the goals of the system from scratch. This meant using a ER Diagram to build our database blueprint, specifically using Crow's Foot notation. We then had to use DDL to create the database and python scripts to interact with the database to insert sample data and to interact with the data. This was done using an ORM, such as SQLAlchemy. 
Disclaimer: We were allowed to use AI generation for this project if needed.
